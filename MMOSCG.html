            <p>
                “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to
                change the world." Nelson Mandela

            <p>
                Before the start of the civil war in March 2011, Syria was a
                country that was capable of providing for its people, with a
                rate of school enrollment of almost 100%. Nowadays, due to
                armed groups targeting schools, schoolchildren, and teachers as
                military strategy, there are almost 2.8 million children out
                of school.*

             <p>
                 Our aim is to provide education in the form of a Self-Learning
                 Programme designed to encourage children to continue studying
                 at home, in community learning centres and even abroad, using
                 the self-learning materials where possible. It is provided in
                 the form of an app to make learning easier and fun. They will
                 have the possibility to get the same subjects they were going
                 to be taught at their own schools, and the app is developed so
                 t adapts to the users own level of knowledge. In this way,
                 they will be provided the correct level of dificulty and be
                 challenged accordingly, to encourage our users to continue
                 using the app until they fulfill the course.
