                        <p>“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." Nelson Mandela</p>
                        
                        <p> We believe that children are the future and education is the key to a good one. </p>

                        <p> Before the start of the civil war in March 2011, Syria was a country that was capable of providing for its people, with a rate of school enrollment of almost 100%. Nowadays, due to armed groups targeting schools, schoolchildren, and teachers as military strategy, there are almost 2.8 million children out of school.*</p>

                        <p> Our aim is to provide education in the form of a Self-Learning 
						Programme designed to encourage children to continue studying at home, 
						in community learning centres and even abroad, using the self-learning 
						materials where possible. It is provided in the form of an app to make 
						learning easier and fun. They will have the possibility to get the same 
						subjects they were going to be taught at their own schools, and the app 
						is developed so it adapts to the users own level of knowledge. In this way, 
						the students will be provided the correct level of dificulty and be challenged 
						accordingly, to encourage our users to continue using the app until they 
						fulfill the course. We have designed this app taking into consideration the 
						environment our students live in and the psychological impacts it has on their 
						well-beings. Although it is supposed to be an educational app, it was not made 
						to be exactly like a school, with all the restraints and stress a student life 
						offers in Syria. It is meant to add something to their peace of mind and remind 
						them that, despite the circumstances, they do matter.</p>

                        <h1 id="Solution"> What do we offer? </h1>
                        
                        <p>In addition to mathematics, science, geography, 
						users will have access to lectures in arabic languages 
						and English. We also provide subjects that were instrinsic 
						to the Syrian system before they were taken out of the 
						curriculum or modified. Among them: national education, 
						social studies, history, artistic composition education, 
						philosophy, psychology and Islamic and Christian religious education.
						All subjects will be offered in classes with real teachers 
						through video with subtitles and audio, which makes it accessible 
						to all students. For example, for people with hearing disabilities 
						or visual impairment. The students also have access to physical 
						education videos through which they can not only improve their physical 
						health but also their psychological, because it serves as a distraction 
						from their reality. In the app, there is a navigation bar in which includes 
						“lessons of the day”, games, quizzes, “test yourself” for every subject.
						At the end of every lesson of the day, there is the possibility for the 
						students to choose between games or tests, through which they can test 
						their abilities and improve themselves. In case they get a wrong answer, 
						the app guides them to the correct one. In this way it motivates them to 
						keep going. The app provides the parents and kids with suggestions on 
						health and lifestyle. For instance:  what types of food to eat, things 
						that can exhilarate their state of mind, the importance of sleep and 
						exercise. We have an agreement with a music streaming company that will 
						make it possible for the app users to have access to music from all over 
						the world, including their cultural music. The app also has a section 
						for parents, in which they can log in and follow their children’s activities, 
						progress and homework. This strengthen the bond between the parents and the children. 
						We believe that even though most kid don’t have the opportunity to go to school, 
						they can still have the feeling of being at school and having responsibilities.
						The app works offline and it is already installed in the mobile phones we are going 
						to send to Syria with the sponsorship of the Norwegian government.</p>
