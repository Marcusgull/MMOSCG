                <h2>Background: War and its effect on education</h2>
                <img src="img/school-49.jpg" />
                <p>“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." Nelson Mandela</p>
                <p> Before the start of the civil war in March 2011, Syria was a country that was capable of providing for its people, 
                with a rate of school enrollment of almost 100%. Nowadays, due to armed groups targeting schools, 
                schoolchildren, and teachers as military strategy, there are almost 2.8 million children out of school.</p>

                <h2> Your future in the palm of your hands </h2>
                <img src="img/cell-phone-in-hand.jpg" />
                <p> Our aim is to provide education in the form of a Self-Learning Programme 
                designed to encourage children to continue studying at home, in community 
                learning centres and even abroad, using the self-learning materials where 
                possible. It is provided in the form of an app to make learning easier and fun. 
                They will have the possibility to get the same subjects they were going to 
                be taught at their own schools, and the app is developed so it adapts to the 
                users own level of knowledge. In this way, the students will be provided the 
                correct level of dificulty and be challenged accordingly, to encourage our 
                users to continue using the app until they fulfill the course.</p>
